# 📊 Social Media Interaction Analysis

This project explores social media usage patterns using data collected from a reel-based survey. The goal is to understand how demographics and behavior relate to activity levels and happiness on social platforms.

## 📝 Overview

I conducted a short survey on social media and collected user responses, including age, gender, daily usage, platform preferences, and self-reported happiness. To enrich the dataset while preserving trends, I expanded it using AI-generated data for better visual representation and deeper insights.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **SQL Server** for querying and analysis  
- **Excel/CSV** for initial data  
- **AI tools** to simulate additional data while keeping patterns consistent

## 📂 Dataset Columns

- `Gender`
- `AgeGroup`
- `DailyUsage`
- `ActivityLevel`
- `HappinessScore`
- `PreferredTimeSlot`
- `PlatformsUsed` (comma-separated)

## 🔍 Key SQL Queries

- **Gender & Age Group Counts**
- **Daily Usage vs. Average Happiness**
- **Age Group vs. Activity Level**
- **Preferred Time Slot Analysis**
- **Platform Usage Trends**
- **Platform Preference by Gender & Age**
- **Data Cleaning for Time Slot Values**
- **Age Group vs. Daily Usage Time**

Each query helps uncover trends in how different user groups interact with social media.
